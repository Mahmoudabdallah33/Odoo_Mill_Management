 <h2> Odoo Concepts Applied:</h2>
<p>
   <p>1- Modular Design: The system is designed as a set of interrelated modules, each handling a specific aspect of the mill’s operations.</p>
   <p>2- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): The system uses Odoo’s ORM.</p>
   <p>3- Views and Actions: The system uses Odoo’s views (forms, lists, kanban, etc.) and actions to provide a user-friendly interface.</p>
   <p>4- Workflow Management: The system uses Odoo’s workflow management features to automate various processes.</p>
   <p>5- Inheritance and Extension: The system extends and customizes Odoo’s existing modules to meet the specific needs of the mill.</p>
